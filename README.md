# cs0320 Term Project 2020

**Team Members:** Nasheath Ahmed, Andrew Boden, Henry Lucco, Jake Zhang

**Team Strengths and Weaknesses:** 
- Strengths: Graphics & GUI, Algorithms & Datastructures, Class Heirarchy/Organization, Databases
- Weaknesses: AI, Performance/Optimization

**Project Idea(s):** _Fill this in with three unique ideas! (Due by March 2)_
### Idea 1: Farming Simulator

TA Review: Approved pending change, likely yes, but right now it's just a replica of a game that already exists. There is also not a significant algorithmic component to the implementation.


### Idea 2: Interactive Calendar

TA Review: Rejected - this feature already exists in google calendar, and the algorithmic complexities behind this project are not complex enough for the class. 

**Note:** You must submit updated ideas for your term project. Also please remove the word document and put the information in this README file.

**Mentor TA:** _Put your mentor TA's name and email here once you're assigned one!_

## Meetings

**Specs, Mockup, and Design Meeting:** _(Schedule for on or before March 13)_

**4-Way Checkpoint:** _(Schedule for on or before April 23)_

**Adversary Checkpoint:** _(Schedule for on or before April 29 once you are assigned an adversary TA)_

## How to Build and Run
